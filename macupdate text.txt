Doorman is the password generator the world waited for...ok, it isn't, but it is a password generator that you will like.

You can get a random password with the length you wish and restrain the symbols that should be used. You can combine letters in lower and upper case, numbers and special characters. 
Furthermore Doorman can generate speakable passwords that are easier to remember because they follow the syllable construction pattern of natural language.
